### Context
Currently, there are more than 100 tenants throughout the SingHealth cluster in 4 hospitals, 2 specialist canters and 1 community hospital. Staff from each institution currently conducts frequent audits (frequency policy: minimum twice a month up to twice a week) on tenants using a manual checklist to ensure compliance with safety, health and hygiene standards. They also ensure tenancy compliance with HPB’s no sugar policy and lower calorie healthier food choices. Photos of non-compliance are currently taken on mobile phones and later emailed to tenants for follow up. Tenants will either email back a photo showing the improved state or the staff will go down to check on the shop/stall again. Audit scores are added up to determine the performance of each shop/stall and are translated into an excel spreadsheet by institution to monitor trends.
